            <h2>Alexander Hamilton</h2>
            <p>
                The American Revolution was a moment of opportunity—a chance to challenge the old world 
                and build something entirely new. For Alexander Hamilton, the war was more than a fight for 
                independence; it was a proving ground.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born in the Caribbean and left without family or fortune, Hamilton relied on his 
                intellect and determination to rise. His talent for writing and strategy earned 
                him a place among revolutionary leaders, where ideas moved as powerfully as weapons. 
                Every letter, argument, and decision was driven by urgency—the belief that time was 
                always running out.
            </p>

            <p>
                Within this world of ambition and conflict, Hamilton began to shape not only a nation, 
                but his own legacy. His personal story is inseparable from the Revolution itself, 
                defined by motion, risk, and an unyielding desire to matter.
            </p>

        <div class="eliza-content">
            <img src="../images/2.png" alt="Eliza Schuyler" class="content-image">
            <h2>Eliza Schuyler</h2>
            <p>
                The American Revolution brought uncertainty into everyday life, 
                touching families and communities as deeply as it shaped the future of a nation. 
                For Eliza Schuyler, this period was marked not by ambition, but by responsibility and care.
            </p>

            <p>
                Raised in a prominent New York family, Eliza was taught the importance of compassion, 
                duty, and service. While war reshaped society, she witnessed its human cost—the fear, 
                loss, and endurance of those left behind. Her world was one of relationships, faith, 
                and quiet strength rather than political power.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the Revolution unfolded, Eliza’s life became connected to events far larger than herself.
                 Her story reveals how love, patience, and resilience existed alongside war, reminding us 
                 that history is shaped not only by those who lead battles, but also by those who carry its 
                 aftermath.
