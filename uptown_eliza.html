                <p><strong>The Duel.</strong> When I learned that Philip had accepted a duel with George Eacker, my heart sank. He was only nineteen, and he believed he was doing the honorable thing by defending his father’s name after Eacker spoke against him. I knew duels were dangerous, no matter the intention. I feared that the same code of honor that ruled his father’s life was now claiming our son.</p>

            <div class="card-explanation">
                <p><strong>The Home.</strong> After Philip’s death, I could not remain in the city. Every street reminded me of him. Moving uptown was my attempt to protect what remained of my family and to grieve in peace, away from the politics and cruelty that had already taken too much from us.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card-explanation">
                <p><strong>Guilt.</strong> I see how deeply Alexander blames himself. He believes Philip’s death was caused by his own enemies and reputation. Though I share his grief, I wish he would allow himself to mourn without punishment. His silence tells me his guilt is heavier than words.</p>

            <div class="card-explanation">
                <p><strong>Forgiveness.</strong> Forgiving Alexander was not easy, but I chose it. I knew anger would only leave us more broken. Forgiveness, for me, was a way to keep our family alive after such devastating loss.</p>
